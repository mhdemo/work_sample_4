## Introduction

It feels as though superhero movies have taken over the box office. Its
almost hard to name a popular actor who hasn’t had an appearance in at
least one film where people can fly or move things with their minds. The
goals of this project is dig deeper into the growth of superhero movies
and ultimately determine what percentage of popular actor’s have been
such films. This analysis is extremely subjective, but it does give me a
great opportunity to utilize the `purrr` package to automate API calls.
