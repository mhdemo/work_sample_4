## Introduction

It feels as though superhero movies have taken over the box office. It’s
hard to name a popular actor who hasn’t appeared in at least one film
where people can fly or move things with their minds. The goal of this
project is to dig deeper into the growth of superhero movies and
ultimately determine what percentage of popular actors have been in such
films. This analysis is extremely subjective, but it does give me a
great opportunity to utilize the `purrr` package to automate API calls.

All of the code used to conduct this analysis will be available in this
repository. More in-depth explanations of the code used will be
available in various posts on my
website.<https://mhdemoblog.netlify.app/>

## tl;dr

Superhero movies have become more expensive, profitable, and abundant
over the last 15 years. Nearly 1 in every 3 active famous actors has
been in a superhero movie. Stan Lee was a very busy man.

## TMDb API

All of the data used in this analysis, will be queried from The Movie
Database. This site offers an API that is free to access with no rate
limiting. More information on the TMDb API can be found on their fact
page.

[TBDb API Documentation](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)

## Packages

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(glue)
library(jsonlite)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
library(scales)
library(patchwork)
library(ggfittext)
library(xfun)
```

## The Queries Pt 1

Before I can conduct my analysis I will need to query the data using the
API. So what’s the best way to start?

### Searching for Keywords

First I need to find all of the keywords that contain the word
“superhero” and save the IDS for those keywords.

``` r
keyword_search <- "superhero"

fromJSON(glue("https://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/keyword?\\
                api_key={Sys.getenv('THE_MOVIE_DB_KEY')}\\
                &query={keyword_search}")) %>%
  pluck(2) %>% 
  head()
```

    ##                 name     id
    ## 1          superhero   9715
    ## 2       superheroine  10843
    ## 3     superhero team 155030
    ## 4    superhero spoof 157677
    ## 5 death of superhero 174016
    ## 6   masked superhero 180734

``` r
super_hero_key_ids <- fromJSON(glue("https://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/keyword?\\
                api_key={Sys.getenv('THE_MOVIE_DB_KEY')}\\
                &query={keyword_search}")) %>%
  pluck(2) %>% 
  pull(2)
```

### Superhero Movie Ids

Using the keyword IDS I can search for any movies that contain those
keywords. I just need to determine how many pages of results there are,
create a function that queries the individual pages, and use the `map`
function to iterate over those pages.

``` r
# without_genres=16 - removes movies classified as animation
# with_release_type=3 - filters for theatrical releases
(page_count <- fromJSON(glue("https://api.themoviedb.org/3/discover/movie?\\
                       api_key={Sys.getenv('THE_MOVIE_DB_KEY')}\\
                       &certification_country=US&language=en-US&\\
                       without_genres=16&\\
                       with_release_type=3\\
                       &region=US\\
                       &with_keywords=\\
                       {glue_collapse(super_hero_key_ids, sep = '|')}\\
                       &primary_release_date.gte=1970-01-01")) %>%
  pluck(3))
```

    ## [1] 10

``` r
super_discover_query <- function(page_num) {
  fromJSON(glue("https://api.themoviedb.org/3/discover/movie?\\
                       api_key={Sys.getenv('THE_MOVIE_DB_KEY')}\\
                       &certification_country=US&language=en-US&\\
                       without_genres=16&\\
                       with_release_type=3\\
                       &region=US\\
                       &with_keywords=\\
                       {glue_collapse(super_hero_key_ids, sep = '|')}\\
                       &primary_release_date.gte=1970-01-01&page={page_num}")) %>%
    pluck(4)
}

super_discover_query(1) %>%
  glimpse()
```

The function appears to work as the first two movies visible from the
`title` column are <i>Bloodshot</i> and <i>The New Mutants</i>. Next up
is the iteration.

``` r
hero_movie_id <- map_df(1:page_count,
                        ~super_discover_query(.x)) %>%
  pull(id)

hero_movie_id %>% 
  glimpse()
```

    ##  int [1:197] 338762 340102 299536 284054 299534 429617 299537 399579 287947 335983 ...

The results from the pages were combined into a single data frame. I
then used the `pull` function again to extract a vector containing the
movie ids. It looks as though there have been 197 movies released in
American theaters since Jan 1, 1970 that have been classified as
superhero films.

### Movie Details

I could use the rest of the data found in the discover API call, but I
want to know more. Have the budgets for superhero movies changed since
1970? Have they become more profitable? Additional information on these
movies’ cost and performance can be found using a slightly different API
call. Querying the data requires a similar process as collecting all of
the movie IDS.

``` r
super_detail_query <-  function(movie_id) {

  fromJSON(glue("https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/{movie_id}?\\
                api_key={Sys.getenv('THE_MOVIE_DB_KEY')}&language=en-US"))
}

super_detail_query(hero_movie_id[1]) %>%
  glimpse()
```

    ##  $ vote_count           : int 3083

Wow\! This list contains a combination of lists and data frames. I can
see some fields that I’m interested in, such as `budget` and
`vote_average`. I just need to map over the movie IDS and transform
these list elements into a single data frame.

``` r
super_movies <- xfun::cache_rds({
  map(hero_movie_id,
       ~super_detail_query(.x)) %>%
    map_df(~as_tibble(t(.x))) %>%
    select(budget, imdb_id, original_title, title,
           release_date, revenue, runtime, status, vote_average,
           vote_count, id) %>%
    unnest(cols = everything()) %>%
    rename(movie_id = id) %>% 
    mutate(release_date = date(release_date))
})
```

super_movies %>%
  glimpse()

This looks much easier to interpret. All of the information that I want
is in a nice data frame and ready for some exploratory data analysis.

## Super Analysis

How many superhero movies have been released per year since 1970? Have
these movies become more profitable over time? I’ll attempt to answer
these questions with some simple plots. I’ve also chosen to adjust the
financial figures for inflation.

``` r
super_movies %>%
  mutate(release_year = year(release_date)) %>%
  filter(release_year < year(Sys.Date())) %>%
  count(release_year) %>%
  ggplot(aes(release_year, n)) +
  geom_line() + geom_point() +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = breaks_width(1)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = breaks_width(5)) +
  theme(panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank()) +
  labs(x = "Release Year", title = "Superhero Movies Released by Year")
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)<!-- -->

There has definitely been an upward trend in the number of superhero
movies released per year. More of these types of films start to pop up
around the mid 2000s. But were these newer superhero films more
successful than their older counterparts?

``` r
cpi_data <- read_csv("Data/cpi_data.csv")
curr_cpi <- cpi_data %>% 
  tail(1) %>% 
  pull(avg_cpi)
cpi_data <- cpi_data %>% 
  mutate(inf_rate = curr_cpi / avg_cpi) %>% 
  select(-avg_cpi)

super_movies_adj <- super_movies %>% 
  mutate(release_year = year(release_date)) %>%
  left_join(cpi_data, by = c("release_year" = "year")) %>% 
  mutate(across(.cols = c(budget, revenue),
                .fns = ~ inf_rate * .x,
                .names = "{col}_inf_adj"),
         profit = revenue_inf_adj - budget_inf_adj,
         roi = profit / budget_inf_adj)

super_summ <- super_movies_adj %>%
  filter(release_date < Sys.Date(), budget_inf_adj > 100000) %>%
  mutate(profit = revenue_inf_adj - budget_inf_adj,
         roi = profit / budget_inf_adj) %>%
  group_by(release_year) %>%
  summarize(across(.cols = c(budget_inf_adj, revenue_inf_adj, profit, roi),
                   .fns = median,
                   .names = "med_{col}"),
            .groups = "drop") %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = contains("med"), names_to = "metric")

super_summ %>%
  filter(metric != "med_roi", release_year < year(Sys.Date())) %>%
  ggplot(aes(release_year, value, col = metric)) +
  geom_line() + geom_point() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar, breaks = breaks_width(250000000)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = breaks_width(5)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(x = "Release Year", col = "Metric", title = "Median Performance by Year")
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
super_summ %>%
  filter(metric == "med_roi", release_year < year(Sys.Date())) %>%
  ggplot(aes(release_year, value)) +
  geom_line() + geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = breaks_width(5)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) +
  labs(x = "Release Year", y = "ROI", title = "Median ROI by Year")
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-10-2.png)<!-- --> There appear
to be some early superhero films that performed great at the box office
and offered investors some amazing returns. However, the highest returns
seem to be held by movies released after 2012. There also appear to be
less occurrences of annual losses for this genre after 2012. This could
be a product of studios’ improved understanding of how to produce and
market these types of movies.

Before I move on to collecting the cast information, I’d like to know
what the top performing movie of each decade was.

``` r
super_movies_adj %>% 
  filter(budget > 100000, release_date < Sys.Date()) %>% 
  mutate(decade = glue("{release_year - (release_year %% 10)}'s")) %>% 
  group_by(decade) %>% 
  slice_max(order_by = profit,
            n = 1) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(decade, profit, label = glue("{title}\n{percent(roi)} ROI"))) + geom_col() +
  geom_bar_text(reflow = TRUE) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar) +
  labs(x = "Decade", y = "Profit")
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)<!-- -->

This plot is pretty interesting. <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> is by far the
greatest superhero success at the box office, but 1989’s <i>Batman</i>
offered investors a higher rate of return at a whopping 1,075 % ROI. The
2020s have only shown negative returns for superhero films at the time
of this analysis.

## The Queries Pt 2

The movie data that I’ve collected so far is great, but it lacks any
information on the cast for each film. I’ll have to use a slightly
different set of API calls to collect all of the cast listing for the
movies I’ve identified.

``` r
cast_query <- function(movie_id) {
  fromJSON(glue("https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/{movie_id}\\
                /credits?api_key={Sys.getenv('THE_MOVIE_DB_KEY')}"))
}

super_cc <- xfun::cache_rds({
  map(hero_movie_id, ~cast_query(.x))
})

super_cast <- super_cc %>% 
  map_df(~as_tibble(t(.x))) %>% 
  select(-crew) %>% 
  unnest(c(id, cast), names_repair = "unique") %>% 
  rename(movie_id = 1, actor_id = 6, actor = 7) %>% 
  select(movie_id:order)
```

    ## New names:
    ## * id -> id...1
    ## * id -> id...6

Now that I have the cast data I can join it together with the rest of
the movie data.

``` r
super_data <- super_cast %>% 
  left_join(super_movies_adj,
            by = "movie_id") %>% 
  relocate(movie_id, title, budget_inf_adj, revenue_inf_adj, profit, character)
```

Before I move on to the last step, I’d like to answer a couple more
questions. First up, what actor has been in the most superhero movies?
This question should be pretty easy to answer for any MCU fan.

``` r
super_data %>% 
  count(actor) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  head()
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 x 2
    ##   actor                  n
    ##   <chr>              <int>
    ## 1 Stan Lee              43
    ## 2 Chris Evans           13
    ## 3 Samuel L. Jackson     13
    ## 4 Jimmy Star            12
    ## 5 Robert Downey Jr.     11
    ## 6 Scarlett Johansson    10

``` r
super_data %>% 
  filter(actor == "Stan Lee") %>% 
  slice_max(order_by = release_date, n = 1) %>% 
  select(title, release_date, actor, character)
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 4
    ##   title             release_date actor    character
    ##   <chr>             <date>       <chr>    <chr>    
    ## 1 Avengers: Endgame 2019-04-24   Stan Lee Driver

Stan Lee has made a cameo in nearly every Marvel film with his last
being <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>. His cameos were always a great touch in
the films. The other actors below Mr. Lee in appearances makes sense
except for one. Who is this Jimmy Star guy? If I dig a little deeper I
might be able to find out.

``` r
jimmy_credits <- pluck(fromJSON(glue("https://api.themoviedb.org/3\\

## The Finale

The last thing that I need is collect a list of popular people as
defined by TMDb.

``` r
pop_pages <- fromJSON(glue("https://api.themoviedb.org/3/person/popular\\
              ?api_key={Sys.getenv('THE_MOVIE_DB_KEY')}&language=en-US")) %>% 
  pluck(3)

# Function to query the data from the popular search
pop_query <- function(page_num) {

fromJSON(glue("https://api.themoviedb.org/3/person/popular\\
              ?api_key={Sys.getenv('THE_MOVIE_DB_KEY')}&language=en-US&page={page_num}")) %>% 
    pluck(4)
}

# Maps pop_query functions over the total number of a pages
pop_actors <- xfun::cache_rds({
  map_df(.x = c(1:pop_pages),
         ~pop_query(.x))
})

pop_actors %>% 
  select(popularity:name) %>% 
  slice_sample(n = 10)
```

    ##    popularity known_for_department                  name
    ## 1       2.477               Acting           Carla Salle
    ## 2       3.681               Acting    Kimberlee Peterson
    ## 3       3.272               Acting        Carmen Electra
    ## 4       2.500               Acting            Tim Guinee
    ## 5       2.891               Acting        Gözde Kocaoğlu
    ## 6       2.943               Acting           Clu Gulager
    ## 7       2.325               Acting       Bumper Robinson
    ## 8       2.101               Acting William Chan Wai-Ting
    ## 9       2.324               Acting          Benjie Paras
    ## 10      2.240               Acting          Richard Egan

This list is great but it contains some popular people that I don’t
want. I only want to focus current, popular, movie actors. I decided to
filter for actors who have been in a American movie since 2005 and who
are in the 75th percentile based upon the popularity metric.

``` r
top_pop_perf <- pop_actors %>%
  # Unnest the known_for data frames for each actor
  unnest(known_for, names_repair = "unique") %>% 
  rename(actor = 3, actor_id = 4,
         movie_id = 11) %>% 
  # Removes missing release date rows
  filter(release_date > 0) %>%  
  mutate(release_date = date(release_date)) %>% 
  group_by(actor) %>% 
  # Filters for the oldest known_for item for each actor
  slice_min(order_by = release_date, n = 1) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(release_date > "2005-01-01", media_type == "movie", 
         known_for_department == "Acting", 
         original_language == "en") %>%
  # Creates a quantile value for each actor based upon their popularity
  mutate(q_rank = ntile(popularity, 4)) %>% 
  filter(q_rank == 4) %>% 
  select(actor, actor_id)

top_pop_perf %>% 
  nrow()
```

    ## [1] 734

``` r
top_pop_perf %>% 
  slice_sample(n = 10)
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 x 2
    ##    actor            actor_id
    ##    <chr>               <int>
    ##  1 Robert Redford       4135
    ##  2 Elizabeth Olsen    550843
    ##  3 Trish Stratus      238367
    ##  4 Rosa Salazar       973667
    ##  5 Monique Coleman    180279
    ##  6 Josh Stamberg       21882
    ##  7 Brenton Thwaites  1017347
    ##  8 Blake Lively        59175
    ##  9 Bill Nighy           2440
    ## 10 Richard Harmon     144852

After filtering I’ve narrowed the pool down to the top 734 actors. A
sample of this pool should show more recognizable names.

I can use the setdiff function to identify the popular actors who have
never been in a superhero film.

``` r
non_supers <- top_pop_perf %>% 
  dplyr::setdiff(super_data %>% 
                   distinct(actor, actor_id))

(super_perc <- percent(1 - nrow(non_supers) / nrow(top_pop_perf)))
```

    ## [1] "31%"

``` r
non_supers %>% 
  slice_sample(n = 15)
```

    ## # A tibble: 15 x 2
    ##    actor             actor_id
    ##    <chr>                <int>
    ##  1 Dylan Minnette      112476
    ##  2 Helen Mirren         15735
    ##  3 Jessie T. Usher     198847
    ##  4 Robert Forster        5694
    ##  5 Mary Mouser        1223084
    ##  6 David Schwimmer      14409
    ##  7 Hermione Corfield  1345419
    ##  8 Julia Winter          1286
    ##  9 Odette Annable       51992
    ## 10 Lee Byung-hun        25002
    ## 11 Natalie Martinez     76511
    ## 12 Thomas Elms        1780950
    ## 13 Rachelle Lefevre     58168
    ## 14 Jake Choi          1474019
    ## 15 Geraldine James      11855

``` r
top_pop_perf %>% 
  slice_sample(n = 3)
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 x 2
    ##   actor           actor_id
    ##   <chr>              <int>
    ## 1 Ben Mendelsohn     77335
    ## 2 James Frain        22063
    ## 3 Anthony Hopkins     4173

After a little work I have my very rough estimate of how many popular
actors have been in a superhero film, 31%. So roughly 1 out of every 3
popular actors is a pretty big proportion. Throughout this process I
noticed some exceptions that seemed to crop up. Eva Mendes is
categorized as a non-super but she starred in 2007’s <i>Ghost Rider</i>,
which isn’t designated as a superhero film. Subjective factors like this
have influenced every facet of this analysis.
