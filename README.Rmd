## Introduction
It feels as though superhero movies have taken over the box office. Its almost hard to name a popular actor who hasn't had an appearance in at least one film where people can fly or move things with their minds. The goals of this project is dig deeper into the growth of superhero movies and ultimately determine what percentage of popular actor's have been such films. This analysis is extremely subjective, but it does give me a great opportunity to utilize the `purrr` package to automate API calls.
